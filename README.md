# FieldAnimation #
FIELDANIMATION a Python package to handle quantity-aware configuration files

### In short ###
Field Animation is a Python package for the visualization of 2D vector fields
that exploits the capabilities of modern graphic cards. Vector fields are rep-
resented through particles that move along the flow lines of the field at a
speed and color proportional to its modulus in an OpenGL window. Inter-
active control of speed, color and number of animated particles is possible as
the whole rendering process happens in the GPU in real time. A background
image can be shown to add information for the interpretation of the results.

Highlights:

* Animation parameters can be changed in real time

* The OpenGL window can be embedded in any Python application.
